# Tableau-Visualizations

This data-viz was made using Tableau Public which is a free version of the Tableau data visualization software.

## Challenge:
It's EOFY (end of financial year) and that means it's time for annual bonuses.

The store operates in three regions and only the top-performing representative in each region qualifies for a bonus. Find out which three employees are eligible to get bonuses this year. Employees are measured in total sales ($$).
